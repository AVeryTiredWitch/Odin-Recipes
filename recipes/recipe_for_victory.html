        Brisket takes the win 
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul><p>
            <li>Guilty Gear Strive in either console or PC</li>
            <li>Brisket DLC or SEASON PASS 2</li>
        </p></ul>
        <h2><p>Receta</p></h2>
        <ol><p>
            <li>2S or f.S ~ S > 236K [6] (K) or 5H ~ H > 236K [6] (K) </li>
            <p>If 2S, f.S, or 5H is followed up with its respective button, S or H it will launch the opponent full screen, and wall bounce if near corner.

                Midscreen hits from these normals when followed up with Kick Start My Heart [6]
                , will automatically time and space Bridget for Meaty c.S. Note that this c.S can be backdashed, 2S will meaty and catch backdashes. If you chose to go for another option keep in mind Bridget is +10 after Kick Start My Heart [6].
                Near the corner and from counterhits Kick Start Your Heart [6] and Shoot
                 will connect allowing for additional damage, and leaving you at significant advantage but no longer auto-timing.</p>

            <li>2K / 5K > 2D > 214S</li>
            <p>Simple combos off Bridget's lightest buttons that allow for dangerous oki with Rolling Movement
                . Can alternatively go into Kick Start My Heart for more damage but this is generally ill-advised unless it will close out the round.</p>

            <li>c.S > dl. f.S//2S > 5H > 236K~K</li>
            <p>Requires delay after c.S for the oppenent to land out of floating crumple.
                Will not work on airborne hit.
                Will not work at greater distances (such as if c.S was linked into out of an aerial).</p>
        </p></ol>
